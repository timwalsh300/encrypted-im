# encrypted-im

This was a small academic exercise to learn Python socket programming 
and cryptographic libraries. The code runs on two machines, one with the 
client option and one with the server option, configured with a 
pre-shared key for the encryption. It uses AES in CBC mode for 
encryption with HMAC-SHA256 for integrity and authentication from 
pycrypto.
