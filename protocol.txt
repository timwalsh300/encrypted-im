In this protocol, each transmitted message consists
of the following, concatenated together...

16-byte random IV || 64-byte ciphertext || 20-byte HMAC tag

The ciphertext is computed with AES in CBC-mode using the
SHA256 hash of the agreed upon [confkey]. Decryption
yields a UTF-8 encoded message string, padded to exactly
64 bytes in a manner similar to PKCS#7, but messages are
limited to 63 bytes long so that every message has at least
one byte of padding on the end. Messages are broken up
into 63-byte chunks and encrypted/authenticated separately
to achieve this. This fixed-length scheme ensures that the
recipient knows when they have read the entire message chunk
from the socket.

The HMAC is computed over the random IV and the ciphertext
concatenated together, using SHA1 as the underlying hash
algorithm and the SHA256 hash of the agreed upon [authkey].
